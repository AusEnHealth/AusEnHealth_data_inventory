First we describe the approach to use a relational data model of linking files within datasets within projects. Files, Datasets and Projects in the Ecological Metadata Language (EML) The Ecological Metadata Language (EML) schema is defined by the ‘Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity’ - KNB (https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#tools/eml). A schematic diagram of the EML modules: The figure below shows EML as a hierarchy. An EML document contains a dataset module that allows the grouping of one or more data entities (e.g. a file) linked together by particular rules to form a Data Package. The project module places the dataset that is being documented into its larger research context, and allows multiple related Data Packages to be linked. Motivation/Justification The backend uses a web2py database app, and R helper functions written by Ivan Hanigan There is a need for a data inventory tool to enable ecological data collections to be managed more efficiently The Ecological Metadata Language (EML) provides an excellent standardised schema for metadata, but the associated software Morpho does not have the flexibility or extensibility that would enable a data manager to use it to manage large and heterogeneous data collections KNB is a subproject of Ecoinformatics.org (http://ecoinformatics.org/) an open source collaboration that aims to produce software, systems, and services primarily for the ecological sciences. We apply these to Human Ecology systems too. XML A minimal EML document is summarised below. This is a schematic view that shows the structure of an EML XML document. Only a few of the possible components are included. In the graphic above the mandatory component of the EML is shown as a firm line, in contrast with those aspects of the EML which are not mandatory (dotted lines). That is: dataset title, creator and contact are the only required elements for a valid EML Data Package. &lt;eml&gt; &lt;dataset&gt; &lt;title&gt; &lt;creator&gt; &lt;contact&gt; &lt;project&gt; &lt;title&gt; &lt;personnel&gt; &lt;role&gt; &lt;abstract&gt; &lt;funding&gt; &lt;studyAreaDescription&gt; &lt;designDescription&gt; &lt;relatedProject&gt; &lt;associatedParty&gt; &lt;publisher&gt; &lt;pubDate&gt; &lt;keywords&gt; &lt;abstract&gt; &lt;intellectualright&gt; &lt;methods&gt; &lt;coverage&gt; &lt;dataTable&gt; &lt;entityName&gt; &lt;entityDescription&gt; &lt;physical&gt; &lt;attribute&gt; &lt;additionalMetadata&gt; &lt;additionalLinks&gt; The parts of an EML document In EML, the term dataset is applied to a document which may contain general information such as the title, creator, and contacts, abstract and keywords as well as one or more data entities, such as datatables, that provide more specific research details. The information is at the level of a particular data collection or study, however there is also a level above this at the “project” level where research studies can be grouped together. In EML, the term dataset refers to one or more data entities. However, there is no generally accepted practice on what to include in an EML-dataset document. Some people will choose to have a one-to-one correspondence between an EML document and a data entity and a single physical file. Others will document several data entities in one dataset document. Below is a brief description of the way we interpret the components of an EML dataset Datasets Dataset is the top level of the EML. The miminum necessary to produce a valid EML document is &lt;title&gt;, &lt;creator&gt;, &lt;contract&gt;. But one can’t tell very much with just a title and a name. Our aim is to create an EML document that contains enough information about the data and research to make funding agencies happy and give other ecologists something to work with. Datasets may include one or more data entities such as data tables and spatial images along with associated metadata, but inclusion of data entities are not mandatory. The dataset module enables entities which are linked together to be grouped logically. LTERN groups entities into a single dataset using a range of integrity constraints such as the use of a specific sampling structure or monitoring theme employed over a discrete temporal and geographic range. In the context of the work undertaken by the LTERN Data Portal Team, the term dataset is sometimes used interchangeably with the term data package, however it should be recognised that these are not exactly the same. The dataset module is a part of an EML document which forms the basis for a data package. In EML, the dataset tag contains general information about a dataset; at minimum this must comprise a title, one Data Creator and a contact (often the Data Creator and contact will be the same). Additional information such as abstract, temporal coverage, keywords, geographic coverage and methods are used to provide context for the published or archived data packages. For more information about the general EML descriptions see: https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#external//emlparser/docs/eml-2.1.1/eml-resource.html For more detailed information about the EML-dataset module see: https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#external//emlparser/docs/eml-2.1.1/eml-dataset.html Projects The project module is optional, but in many cases highly desirable as this provides an overall description of the larger-scale project or research context with which that dataset is associated. For example it might be an entire Longterm Ecological Research Network (LTER) site, or an individual project at an LTER site. The EML “project” module of the EML enables data packages to be grouped logically together. The project module is primarily used by LTERN to identify the Data Owner and the source of funding. The project module is recursive in that it provides an overall description of the larger-scale project or research context for the specific project with which that data package is associated. Information in the project tag of the EML include detailed descriptions of the aims and objectives of the research, funding sources, personnel and a description of the study area. This module also includes content on the study and sampling design and the methods employed during the research. As an example, a project might comprise an entire Long Term Ecological Research Network (LTERN) plot network or an individual project at an LTERN site. For more information about the EML-dataset module see: https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#external//emlparser/docs/eml-2.1.1/eml-project.html Data Entity As stated earlier, a dataset consists of one or more data entities, and the most common data entity is a dataTable. A data table is something that looks like a matrix with rows for observations and columns for variables In addition to datatables, people using database applications may also produce a view from a database management system or a storedProcedure that results in data output. People using GIS (geographical information system) applications generate both spatialVector, also referred to as boundary or shape files, and spatialRaster. A spatialRaster is a geo-referenced image usually produced by a camera on a satellite or other remote sensing device. The final kind of data entity is otherEntity. An otherEntity is a data entity that cannot be represented by any of the previously defined data entity structures. A non-geo-referenced photograph is an otherEntity, e.g., a photograph of two different types of butterflies. For more information about types of EML-entities see: https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#external//emlparser/docs/eml-2.1.1/#N10115 Attributes An attribute or as it is sometime referred to, variable, in this context refers to the name of the column of a datatable For more information about the EML dataTable type (especially its attributes) see: https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#external//emlparser/docs/eml-2.1.1/eml-dataTable.html#attribute "],["datasets-overview.html", "1.1 Datasets Overview", " 1.1 Datasets Overview Provision status categories: Identified, Requested, Provided, Published, TBC "],["acorn-sat.html", "2 ACORN-SAT", " 2 ACORN-SAT metadata_field title ACORN-SAT personnel_data_owner AusEnHealth project_abstract "],["extreme_rainfall.html", "2.1 Extreme_Rainfall", " 2.1 Extreme_Rainfall metadata_field shortname Extreme_Rainfall title Extreme_Rainfall creator Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) contact_email a11.price@qut.edu.au abstract The extreme climate analyses are calculated from homogeneous and high-quality temperature and rainfall datasets respectively.

These values are also representative of the values expected between 11 am and 1 pm local time (12 pm and 2 pm daylight saving time) under clear skies. The UV Index provides a simple measure of the solar UV radiation level at the earths surface and thereby the potential for skin damage. Values can vary from zero upwards - the higher the value the greater the potential for damage to the skin and eye, and the less time it takes for harm to occur. Protective measures need to be taken for UV Index values of 3 or above. The patterns of average monthly clear-sky UV Index largely follow latitude lines with the highest values generally in the north of the continent and the lowest in the south. The Index reaches a peak in January when average values of 11 or more cover virtually all of Australia. These values are clear-sky values only, conditions would otherwise be somewhat tempered by the cloudiness associated with the monsoon in the north. The lowest values occur in June-July where the UV Index averages less than 2 over Tasmania, increasing to almost 8-9 in far northern Australia. It is the varying intensity of solar radiation and ozone throughout the year that mostly accounts for this variation of the UV Index which is evident on the monthly and seasonal maps. additional_metadata /home/public_share_data/ResearchData_CAR/http://www.bom.gov.au/uv/data.shtml alternate_identifier associated_party access_rules Public CC BY 3.0 Australia Licence Recommended Citation Bureau of Meteorology (2016): Average solar ultraviolet (UV) Index.

Reanalysis combines model data with observations from across the world into a globally complete and consistent dataset using a model of the atmosphere based on the laws of physics and chemistry. This principle, called data assimilation, is based on the method used by numerical weather prediction centres and air quality forecasting centres, where every so many hours (12 hours at ECMWF) a previous forecast is combined with newly available observations in an optimal way to produce a new best estimate of the state of the atmosphere, called analysis, from which an updated, improved forecast is issued. Reanalysis works in the same way to allow for the provision of a dataset spanning back more than a decade. Reanalysis does not have the constraint of issuing timely forecasts, so there is more time to collect observations, and when going further back in time, to allow for the ingestion of improved versions of the original observations, which all benefit the quality of the reanalysis product. | | The assimilation system is able to estimate biases between observations and to sift good-quality data from poor data. The atmosphere model allows for estimates at locations where data coverage is low or for atmospheric pollutants for which no direct observations are available. The provision of estimates at each grid point around the globe for each regular output time, over a long period, always using the same format, makes reanalysis a very convenient and popular dataset to work with. | | The observing system has changed drastically over time, and although the assimilation system can resolve data holes, the initially much sparser networks will lead to less accurate estimates. For this reason, EAC4 is only available from 2003 onwards. | | Although the analysis procedure considers chunks of data in a window of 12 hours in one go, EAC4 provides estimates every 3 hours, worldwide. This is made possible by the 4D-Var assimilation method, which takes account of the exact timing of the observations and model evolution within the assimilation window. | | Further information, please see: https://ads.atmosphere.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/cams-global-reanalysis-eac4?tab=overview "],["aec4_pm1.html", "7.1 AEC4_PM1.0", " 7.1 AEC4_PM1.0 metadata_field shortname AEC4_PM1.0 title AEC4_PM1.0 creator Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service contact_email a11.price@qut.edu.au abstract 0.75°x0.75° gridded Particulate matter d &lt; 1 µm (PM1) data derived from CAMS global reanalysis (EAC4) project.

Wildfires can be caused by lightning striking a forest canopy or, in a few isolated cases, by lava or hot rocks ejected from erupting volcanoes. Most fires worldwide are started by humans, sometimes accidentally and sometimes on purpose. Not all fires are bad. Fire clears away dead and dying underbrush, which can help restore forest ecosystems to good health. Humans use fire as a tool in slash-and-burn agriculture to speed up the process of breaking down unwanted vegetation into the soil. Humans also use fire to clear away old-growth forests to make room for living spaces, roads, and fields for raising crops and cattle. But not all fires are good. Wildfires can destroy natural resources and human structures. Globally, fire plays a major role in Earth’s carbon cycle by releasing carbon into the air, and by consuming trees that would otherwise absorb carbon from the air during photosynthesis. These maps show the locations of actively burning fires around the world, detected by instruments aboard NASA satellites.

Selected further data is sourced outside for the Water Regulations, e.g. data supplied from National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS). Groundwater level data in the Australian Groundwater Explorer is updated annually. The currency of the data varies per area and/or data provider. State/Territory agencies submit their data to the Bureau on regular basis depending on the agency. This data is then processed and updated to the Groundwater Explorer. There are approximately 5,000 bores across Australia where regular groundwater level updates occur. Groundwater level information can be presented using different terms or variables including: Depth to water (DTW)—measured from the ground surface to the groundwater level. Positive values are below the ground surface. Negative values are above the ground surface and indicate artesian conditions. This term is sometimes called depth below natural surface (DBNS). Standing water level (SWL)—measured from the reference point on the bore (e.g. the top of casing) to the groundwater level. Positive values are below the reference point and negative values are above the reference point. Reduced standing water level (RSWL)—the groundwater level elevation relative to the Australian Height Datum (AHD). This is the standard height datum used in Australia. It sets mean sea level as zero elevation. Positive values are above mean sea level and negative values are below. additional_metadata /home/public_share_data/ResearchData_CAR/http://www.bom.gov.au/water/groundwater/explorer/metadata.shtml alternate_identifier associated_party access_rules Public CC BY 4.0 International Licence Recommended Citation Bureau of Meteorology (2023): Australian Groundwater Explorer: Groundwater levels.

The study area for the survey is the Sydney Greater Metropolitan Area (GMA) which includes Sydney Greater Capital City Statistical Area (GCCSA), parts of Illawarra and Hunter regions. All residents of occupied private dwellings within the Sydney GMA are considered within scope of the survey and are randomly selected to participate. The HTS has been running continuously since 1997/981 and collects data for all days through the year – including during school and public holidays. Typically, approximately 2,000-3,000 households participate in the survey annually. Data is collected on all trips made over a 24-hour period by all members of the participating households. Annual estimates from the HTS are usually produced on a rolling basis using multiple years of pooled data for each reporting year2. All estimates are weighted to the Australian Bureau of Statistics’ Estimated Resident Population, corresponding to the year of collection3. Unless otherwise stated, all reported estimates are for an average weekday. Due to disruptions in data collection resulting from the lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic, post-COVID releases of HTS data are based on a lower sample size than previous HTS releases. To ensure integrity of the results and mitigate risk of sampling errors some post-COVID results have been reported differently to previous years. Please see below for more information on changes to HTS post-COVID (2020/21 onwards).

This data helps inform policy development and decision makers in the waste and resource recovery industry, local government and Queensland Government about the state’s recycling and waste management activities. The major flooding events that affected Queensland and New South Wales in early 2022 had a significant impact on the recovery rates and interstate waste this financial year.

They are the result of a research project initiated by Healthy Together Geelong. The data was calculated using a sophisticated, proprietary method by Community Indicators Victoria, McCaughey Centre: VicHealth Centre for the Promotion of Mental Health and Community Wellbeing, Melbourne School of Population Health, University of Melbourne in May 2014. Distances to many dozens of features as disparate as greengrocers, bus stops, tobacco sellers, and rail trails were calculated from meshblocks of mostly residential populations. These measures were then aggregated and grouped at the neighbourhood level. The table Geelong_BuiltEnvLookup.csv describes the variables and their meanings; these variables make up the GIS file and are also in Geelong_BuiltEnv.csv. In all there are 95 measures recorded for each suburb. Although all due care has been taken to ensure that these data are correct, no warranty is expressed or implied by the City of Greater Geelong or by the University of Melbourne in their use. The land use dataset was categorised into six different land uses: retail, commercial, health/community, recreation, residential, and other. These categorisations were made on the basis of data supplied by the City of Greater Geelong and VicMap Planning Zones 2013. Land use mix was calculated using an entropy formula. The resulting land use mix measure is a value between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates homogenous land use (i.e. the entire suburb is the same land use) and 1 indicates heterogeneous land use (i.e. there are equal areas of each of the different types of land use of interest). Distances to sites were calculated along street centrelines. Site information was supplied by the City of Greater Geelong. Note that densities are often not spatial densities (eg. number per hectare) but, rather, represent number of sites per population measure or per kilometre of roads. additional_metadata NOT YET PUBLISHED alternate_identifier associated_party access_rules Public CC BY 3.0 Australia Licence Recommended Citation City of Greater Geelong (2023): Built environment inventory.

Polygon attributes describe the public open space category and owner. The datset covers 31 municipalities in metropolitan Melbourne. The definition used to attribute a polyon as public open space is ‘those areas of public land and local council land that have an accepted and ongoing community use for outdoor recreation and informal activities, and that are freely accessible to the public’. The VEAC Metropolitan Melbourne Open Space Inventory does not include Commonwealth land; schools; cemeteries; gated facilities; road plantations; closed roads; concourses around stadia; inaccessible Trust for Nature properties; ‘services and utilities’ public land that does not have an ongoing recreational use; future open space (e.g. areas covered by Public Aquisition Overlays); and uncategorised public land. ‘Public Land’ is Crown land and freehold land owned by Victorian Government Agencies. ‘Local Council Land’ is freehold land owned by local councils. additional_metadata /home/public_share_data/ResearchData_CAR/https://metashare.maps.vic.gov.au/geonetwork/srv/api/records/9362b7a4-3615-5d67-a6bf-e8693d535eb7/formatters/sdm-html?root=html&amp;output=html alternate_identifier associated_party access_rules Public CC BY 4.0 International Licence Recommended Citation Department of Energy, Environment and Climate Action (2018): VEAC Metropolitan Melbourne Open Space Inventory.
